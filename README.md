## Observations

- Check [Requirements](https://github.com/guimatheus92/Bot_BombCrypto#requirements "Requirements") topic to make sure in what environment, tools and versions we know that it works.
- I suggest you to turn off the feature `News and interests` from Windows, because the mouse might pass through it and click in some card without us know. You can turn off this feature from [Turn news and interests feature on and off](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/stay-up-to-date-with-news-and-interests-a39baa08-7488-4169-9ed8-577238f46f8f) guide.
- All images taken from the game was from a Full HD screen and scale at 100%. So if your bot is not working, make sure that your scale is at least 100%. After that, get all pictures again and save them as `.png` format.
